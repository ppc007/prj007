Hello World!

This is my first project in GitHub :)

-007

Example workflow for PR:
http://singularity.lbl.gov/contributing-code

```bash
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master		# really just update my fork.  PR need to be done via web?
                        	# really same as just vanilla git push ?
```


here is a random insignificant change, added to create a PR conflict, 
going test git pull --rebase...

going, really going crazy now.
tin6150 did a pull --rebase, created PR that can be merged automatically.
but after getting the PR, but before accepting/merging it, 
made this change to README.md 
conflict galore? :)
